Some private hospitals organize these features for their own customers, while others access third-party services. For example, if our website is visible online, people can book doctors through our platform. Generally, government doctors do not engage in these activities because they are not allowed to work in two places simultaneously.

Separately, I have developed an admin panel project using PHP. You can integrate the admin panel into this project based on your requirements.

**Working**

First, we need to list out the entire hospital directory for various major cities such as Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli, Trichy, Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, etc. We will assign specific doctor specializations to their profiles, as this is crucial. Some doctors specialize in areas such as eye, kidney, heart, and more. Each patient has a different disease, so we will organize the doctor list accordingly.

Once the doctors are selected, we will provide detailed information about the specific diseases. Following this, doctors will receive notifications from users affected by the disease. Finally, doctors will analyze their schedules and allocate appointments if they are available at the requested time.
